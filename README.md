Can automation help you?

I'm focused on removing repetetive tasks done by people. 

From my student internships over the past 4 summers, I have had lots of first hand experience in repetitive and tedious tasks. I was successful in automating a large portion of my assigned duties so much so that a full days worth of work at the beguinning of one summer was just about 10 minutes of work by the end of the summer by utilizing long python pipelines. Furthermore with the advancement of AI there are so many opportunities for AI to step in and complete these tasks for us. I am an AI optimist, and am saddened by the number of people spending their days staring at a computer screen to complete the tasks that could be done by an automated system. I found one magical python library called <code>self-operating-computer</code> (https://github.com/OthersideAI/self-operating-computer) that feels like a ghost is operating your computer right before your eyes. 

If the technology exists to complete almost all back-office tasks already, why are there still millions of people working these tasks today?
What is the friction that prevents full adoption?

I believe it has to do with fully understanding the task at hand. In my experience, I had to do the tasks over and over again until I understood that it could be automated.

This python project aims to study my own behavior on my computer. It will act as a Trojan Horse, infultrating behind the lines of the computer and begin monitoring my screen activity, keystrokes and mouse clicks to discover repetitive behaviour. The end goal is to study the data and automatically plan these automation processes.
